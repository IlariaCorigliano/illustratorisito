            <h4>BIOGRAFIA</h4>
            <p>The portfolio of LA-based illustrator 
                Xoana Herrera is an explosion of sumptuous, 
                stylish character scenes dwelling in a world 
                that, frankly, looks ideal.</p> 
                
                <p>Xoana trained as a graphic designer in Argentina 
                but over time found herself drawn to 
                the world of illustration after a five-year 
                stint at Buck agency.</p>  
                
                <p>Now, alongside founding a feminist creative collective, Get it Girl, she creates graceful, 
                complex and accessible imagery 
                which would be as at home in an ad campaign 
                as it would be in a children’s book 
                (which she's quite keen to try soon).</p> 
                
                <p>“As an artist I think it is up to us to keep 
                evolving and taking creative decisions,” she says. 
                “Aiming to be innovative is something I feel 
                I can dare to try every time I take a job, 
                and that’s amazing.”</p>
