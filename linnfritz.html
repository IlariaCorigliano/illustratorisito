            <h4>BIOGRAFIA</h4>
            <p>Swedish illustrator, designer and animator 
                Linn Fritz lives and works in London 
                where she creates charmingly clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette 
                for a wide range of editorial and commercial clients.</p> 
                
                <p>Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her time at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as 
                “hands down one of the best experiences” 
                of her life. 
                “My Hyper Island journey completely changed 
                me as a person.” she says. 
                “It pushed me to work harder and gave me 
                the tools to succeed in the real world.”</p>  
                
                <p>The progressive nature of Hyper Island 
                led Linn to abandon pen and paper 
                and concentrate on what digital could offer 
                her already well-honed drawings. 
                As she puts it, “There’s more freedom drawing digitally, and more room for mistakes.”</p>  
                
                <p>Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, 
                “a community of equality-driven women,
                trans and non-binary friends aiming to connect 
                and support each other within the animation industry.” </p> 
                
                <p>Some of her favorite projects often orbit 
                around her interests of “feminism, clothes, 
                plants and interior” but Linn also looks for 
                a good client relationship, one with trust and creative freedom.</p>
