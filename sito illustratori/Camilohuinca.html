            <h4>BIOGRAFIA</h4>
            <p>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, 
                content and a brightly illustrated narrative 
                that speaks for itself.</p> 
                
                <p>Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, 
                Camilo has divided his career between 
                graphic design and painting.</p> 
                
                <p>Working independently has allowed 
                Camilo to “develop (his) own style, 
                having a main focus on 
                the use of curiosity,” he explains.</p> 
                
                <p>In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio 
                where he concentrates on graphic design 
                projects in “a more commercial way”.</p> 
                
                <p>However, within illustration, he described 
                his main motivation as, 
                “to be able to generate a communication 
                method based on simplicity and synthesis, 
                with few tools and colours. 
                I am interested in identifying people’s behaviour, 
                portraying activities, intimate moments, 
                body gestures, disfiguring objects and 
                reducing the amount 
                of detail in a composition.”</p> 
                
                <p>Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, 
                moments and personal habits, 
                often depicting scenic bus routes, art galleries 
                and public figures in his own psychedelically 
                shaped style. 
                “Within my work I try to reproduce real moments 
                from an innocent and impartial perspective.”</p>
